Version 0.3

Improvements made to `LoadandCite` largely suggested by R Journal reviewers. These include:

- improved warnings.

- old packages can be downloaded from any CRAN mirror.

- if `pkgs = NULL` then non-base packages loaded in the current session are cited.

- can use the `style` argument to style the citations for the Journal of Statistical Software.

- automatically includes a citation for the current R version and can check to see if the version of R running matches a specified version.

Other changes

`InstallOldPackages` uses `repo` rather than `oldRepo` argument.

Version 0.2.6.2

Minor example changes.

Version 0.2.6.1 

Minor internal changes.

Version 0.2.6

Minor changes to `LoadandCite`, if `file = NULL` then the packages are loaded but no BibTeX file is created.

Other internal improvements and bug fixes.

Version 0.2.5

Drawing on devtools version 1.2, this `source_data` now us finds sha-1 hashes for files and lets the user compare these with the version of the file they have downloaded. This makes it easier to see if you downloaded the same file you thought you had downloaded.

`source_GitHubData` is now depricated and will not be updated from this point. Please use `source_data` instead.

Minor default settings change for data commands.

Version 0.2.4

Add `source_DropboxData` for loading plain-text data from a non-Public Dropbox folder.

Big hat tip to Kay Cichini (http://thebiobucket.blogspot.com/2013/04/download-files-from-dropbox.html)

Version 0.2.3

Add `source_data`. `source_GitHubData` turned into a wrapper for `source_data`.

Version 0.2.2

Change how default repo in `LoadandCite` is determined/set.

Version 0.2.1

`LoadandCite` repo option now gets repo information from `.Rprofile`. Thanks to Karthik Ram.

Version 0.2

- Add tools to install old R package versions both in a stand alone function (`InstallOldPackages`) and as part of `LoadandCite`.

- the `package` argument for `LoadandCite` is depricated. Use `pkgs` instead. This is so the syntax matches `install.packages syntax better. 


Version 0.1.1

Documentation and external package load fixes.

Version 0.1

Includes the functions `LoadandCite` for loading and citing R packages as well as `source_GitHubData` for downloading plain-text data from GitHub.
