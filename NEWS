Version 0.2.4.1

Minor default settings change for data commands.

Version 0.2.4

Add `source_DropboxData` for loading plain-text data from a non-Public Dropbox folder.

Big hat tip to Kay Cichini (http://thebiobucket.blogspot.com/2013/04/download-files-from-dropbox.html)

Version 0.2.3

Add `source_data`. `source_GitHubData` turned into a wrapper for `source_data`.

Version 0.2.2

Change how default repo in `LoadandCite` is determined/set.

Version 0.2.1

`LoadandCite` repo option now gets repo information from `.Rprofile`. Thanks to Karthik Ram.

Version 0.2

- Add tools to install old R package versions both in a stand alone function (`InstallOldPackages`) and as part of `LoadandCite`.

- the `package` argument for `LoadandCite` is depricated. Use `pkgs` instead. This is so the syntax matches `install.packages syntax better. 


Version 0.1.1

Documentation and external package load fixes.

Version 0.1

Includes the functions `LoadandCite` for loading and citing R packages as well as `source_GitHubData` for downloading plain-text data from GitHub.
