The command\r\nalso creates a [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) bibliography file\r\nwith package citations.\r\n\r\n- `InstallOldPackages`: installs specific R package versions.\r\n\r\n### Functions for loading data into R from the internet:\r\n\r\n- `source_data`: loads plain-text formatted data (e.g. CSV, TSV) or RDATA stored\r\nat a URL (both http and https) into R. **Note:** the command can download data\r\nfrom almost any secure (`https`) URL. This includes data in Dropbox Public\r\nfolders and *published* Google Docs plain-text formatted data sets (see\r\n[Google Docs support pages](http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=37579)\r\nfor details. Note, currently *only the old Google Sheets supports publishing*\r\nsheets to the Web as plain-text files.)\r\n\r\n  - `source_data`, and all of the data download commands in *repmis* find and\r\nreport [SHA-1 hashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) for each file it loads.\r\nYou can use a file's SHA-1 hash to make sure you are downloading the file and\r\nversion of the file you think you are downloading. Note: if you are using\r\n`source_data` to download data from GitHub, `source_data`'s SHA-1 hash is *not\r\nthe same as* the Git commit's SHA-1 hash. (Thanks to Hadley Wickham's\r\n[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package for the code to make this\r\npossible.)\r\n\r\n  - Data downloaded with `source_data` can be cached (so you don't have to\r\nre-download it every time you run a script. To do this use the `cache` argument.\r\n\r\n- `source_DropboxData`: loads plain-text formatted data stored in a Dropbox\r\n**non-Public** folder. See\r\n[this blog post](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/2013/04/dropbox-r-data.html)\r\nfor more details. Also, if you are looking for full Dropbox control (not just\r\ndata downloading) from R see Karthik Ram's\r\n[rDrop](https://github.com/karthikram/rDrop) package.\r\n\r\n- `source_XlsxData`: downloads and loads a data set in Excel format. The\r\nfunction relies on the\r\n[xlsx](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xlsx/index.html) package and can\r\ntake any arguments that `read.xlsx` can.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n- `git_stamp`: function for get git stamp (commit and branch) for a repository.\r\nThanks to Måns Magnusson.\r\n\r\n- `scan_https`: read a character text file from a secure (https) site into R as\r\na single object.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe package is available for download from\r\n[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/repmis/).\r\n\r\nYou can also download the most recent version using the\r\n[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) command `install_github` to\r\ninstall **repmis** in R. Here is the exact code for installing the current\r\nversion:\r\n\r\n```{S}\r\ndevtools::install_github('christophergandrud/repmis')\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-985930-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
