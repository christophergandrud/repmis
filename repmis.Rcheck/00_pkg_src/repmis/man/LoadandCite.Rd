This function is partially based on: \url{https://gist.github.com/3710171}.
It also builds on code from knitr's \code{write_bib}. See: Y. Xie. knitr: A
general-purpose package for dynamic report generation in R, 2013. URL
\url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr}. R package version 1.5. Note
that it does not formally depend on knitr so that knitr can be included in
\code{LoadandCite} so that it is possible to install old versions of that
package.

\usage{
LoadandCite(pkgs = NULL, versions = NULL, Rversion = NULL,
  bibtex = TRUE, style = "plain", tweak = TRUE, install = FALSE,
  file = NULL, repos = NULL, lib = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{a character vector of R package names. If \code{pkgs = NULL} then
\code{LoadandCite} only cites the non-base packages in the current session.
It does not load or install any packages.}

\item{versions}{character vector of package version numbers to install. Only
works if \code{install = TRUE}. The order must match the order of package
names in \code{pkgs}.}

\item{Rversion}{a character string specifying a particular R version. If the
version of R currently running differs from \code{Rversion}
\code{LoadandCite} a warning will be given. This argument is for replication
purposes.}

\item{bibtex}{logical. If \code{TRUE} than a BibTeX formatted citation file
is created. If \code{FALSE} than the citations are returned as plain text.}

\item{style}{character string indicating stylistic elements to add to the
citations. Currently supports \code{'plain'}, i.e. no special formatting and
\code{'JSS'} to match the BibTeX style for the
\emph{Journal of Statistical Software}
(see \url{http://www.jstatsoft.org/style}).}

\item{tweak}{logical. Whether to fix some known problems in the citations,
especially non-standard format of authors.}

\item{install}{a logical option for whether or not to install the packages.
The default is \code{install = FALSE}.}

\item{file}{the name of the BibTeX file you want to create. If
\code{file = NULL} then the packages are loaded, but no BibTeX file is
created.}

\item{repos}{character vector specifying which repository to download
packages from. Only relevant if \code{install = TRUE} and versions are not
specified. If \code{repos = NULL}, automatically reads user defined
repository (via \code{options}), but defaults to
\code{repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"} if \code{repos} is not set.}

\item{lib}{character vector giving the library directories where to install
the packages. Recycled as needed. If \code{NULL}, defaults to the first
element of \code{.libPaths()}. Only relevant if \code{install = TRUE}.}
}
\description{
\code{LoadandCite} can install and load R packages as well as automatically
generate a BibTeX file citing the packages.
}
\details{
The command can install R packages, load them, and create a BibTeX
file that can be used to cite the packages in a LaTeX or similar document. It
can be useful to place this command in a \code{knitr} code chunk at the
beginning of a reproducible research document. Note: the command will
overwrite existing files with the same name as \code{file}, so it is
generally a good idea to create a new BibTeX file with \code{LoadandCite}.

\examples{
# Create vector of package names
## In this example you need to have the packages installed aready.
PackNames <- "repmis"
# Load the packages and create a BibTeX file
LoadandCite(pkgs = PackNames, file = 'PackageCites.bib', style = 'JSS')
\dontrun{
# Install, load, and cite specific package versions
# dontrun due to CRAN restrictions
Names <- c("e1071", "gtools")
Vers <- c("1.6", "2.6.1")
LoadandCite(pkgs = Names, versions = Vers, install = TRUE,
             file = "PackageCites.bib")
